# CS-250-Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

# My Portfolio Submission for the SNHU Travel Project üöÄ

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository includes the Sprint Review and Retrospective document for the SNHU Travel project, where we embraced the Scrum-Agile framework at ChadaTech. This project was a great experience, and I‚Äôve documented some key reflections below to capture what I learned along the way.

## Reflection Questions ü§î

### 1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
Understanding what users really need is the first step in building something they'll love. By breaking down those needs into **user stories**, we can focus on smaller, manageable pieces of work. This not only makes development more straightforward but also keeps us aligned with user expectations. User stories act like a guide, helping us prioritize what‚Äôs important and ensuring we‚Äôre always building features that matter.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I‚Äôm developing programs, I like to take it one step at a time‚Äîiterative and incremental is the way to go! Agile methodologies, especially Scrum, have proven to be super effective. Regular check-ins, sprint planning, and retrospectives keep the team on track and adaptable to changes. Moving forward, I want to keep using these Agile practices to maintain flexibility and deliver high-quality software.

### 3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means being reliable, communicative, and ready to jump in where needed. It‚Äôs about supporting each other, sharing knowledge, and working towards our common goals. It also means being open to feedback and always looking for ways to improve‚Äînot just individually, but as a team.
